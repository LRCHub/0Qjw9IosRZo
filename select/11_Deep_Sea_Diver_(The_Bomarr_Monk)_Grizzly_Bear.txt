I'm a deep sea diver with my fins
And underneath your current I do swim
A baker's dozen pertty pearls
And where I travel on my toes do curl
Cause you, you got everthing that I want
A car, a house, and a dog
You got everything that I want

Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while

I'm a deep sea diver losing air
And around here I'm sad swimming
You don't care
