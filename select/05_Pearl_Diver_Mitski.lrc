[00:30.05] Treasure hunter you are dead, the light of the world is fading
[00:36.14] You cannot see the other end, your body's lost all feeling

[00:48.47] Forgive the sea, follow the tide with the monsters on your shoulder

[01:35.82] And I, I'll live without you, though the struggle will be daily
